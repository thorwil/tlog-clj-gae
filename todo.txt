But how?
--------
Make sure article content is put in <p>, to avoid <br>s
Disable Aloha Save button until there are changes (even better: unless), look into smartContentChange
Fix Aloha blocking in some new comment fields, when adding several comments in succession
Stay exactly on baseline grid
Get rid of dots in Aloha floating panel

Comments
--------
# Validate the links
# New comments following updated ones lack margin
# Update page with comments from other sessions

Cleanup
-------
See if on-add-comment would be nicer written like normal views (watch out for lack of constantly)
use event.target?

Correctness
-----------
Avoid collisions between slugs and fixed routes
Rule out clashes between Comment IDs and slugs (deletion queue)
Do not try to remove CSS class empty for every single comment submission

Considerations
--------------
Consider marking times as GMT and/or specifying time past
Consider New or Add instead of Write
Consider dropping any pretense of IE6 support, maybe even drop html5shiv
