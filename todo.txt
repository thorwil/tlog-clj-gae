Correctness
-----------
Rule out clashes between Comment IDs and slugs (deletion queue)
Do not try to remove CSS class empty for every single comment submission
Check https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Secure_Coding_Guidelines
Better terms than views and models

--------------
Consider marking times as GMT and/or specifying time past
Consider New or Add instead of Write
Consider dropping any pretense of IE6 support, maybe even drop html5shiv

Stay exactly on baseline grid
Get rid of dots in Aloha floating panel
Automatically avoid collisions between article slugs and fixed routes
