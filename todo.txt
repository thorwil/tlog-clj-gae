But how?
--------
Make sure article content is put in <p>, to avoid <br>s
Disable Aloha Save button until there are changes (even better: unless), look into smartContentChange
Fix Aloha blocking in some new comment fields, when adding several comments in succession

Comments
--------
Make author and link admin-editable, too
save-article -> update-article (route and fns)
Fix huge gap before lonely comment field
Keep margin after updated comments
Stay on baselines
Anchor symbol for comment anchor-links
Update page with comments from other sessions
Validate the links

Errors
------
Fix move
Fix tlog.Save: error getting dictionary file http://localhost:8080/scripts/aloha/plugins/tlog.Save/i18n/en.dict

Cleanup
-------
See if on-add-comment would be nicer written like normal views (watch out for lack of constantly)
Get rid of dots in Aloha floating panel
article.js: onkeyup instead of JQuery's keyup()
Comments: use a query in comment.js instead of onmouseover as comment field attribute
Use table, not dl on Write form
hiccup.page-helpers html5
Split out repettion from slug.js and add_article.js
Write macro for view options

Correctness
-----------
Avoid collisions between slugs and fixed routes
Rule out clashes between Comment IDs and slugs (deletion queue)
Do not try removing CSS class empty for every single comment submission

Considerations
--------------
Consider marking times as GMT
Consider New or Add instead of Write
Consider dropping any pretense of IE6 support, maybe even drop html5shiv
